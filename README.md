# Go Plugin Architecture Web Server
This project is a Go framework that enables you to create a web server using a plugin architecture. A plugin is a Go package that implements a specific functionality. The plugins are loaded dynamically by the web server when it starts up.

## Features
The web server can load multiple plugins.
The plugins can be developed independently of the web server.
The plugins can be updated without having to restart the web server.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install Go and the Go plugins development kit.

Once you have installed Go, you can clone this repository to your local machine.
